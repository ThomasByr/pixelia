> Please note we do not officially support Windows or MacOS, but we do provide some instructions for those who want to use it on these platforms.

You do not explicitly need a conda environment for the bot to run. But it is always recommended nontheless, especially because the next LTS of Ubuntu won't let users pip-install anything without a virtual environment. At the time of writing, this app `python >= 3.11` to run.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ThomasByr/pixelia.git
cd pixelia
```

You can create and activate a conda environment with the following commands :

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -y
conda activate pixelia
# alternatively, you can just use pip
# pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, run the discord bot with :

```bash
python pixelia.py
```

We are using [black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format the code, so make sure you have it installed and run :

```ps1

```

> The standard procedure is :

Happy coding ! üôÇ
